Topic - [[Sharp Fangs Behind The Leaves]]
### Intro
Great fun to thrash baseline gameplay with, but struggles hard in the face of adversaries and especially in the face of blight.

Goes all-in on Ranging Hunt and aims to shut out the invaders entirely by rapidly devouring their entire society. All of your combat power is in that left innate and you REALLY feel it once they get a chance to build in a blighted land. Don't let that happen! And don't let things blight!!! (Especially your coast)

### Opening
1. G2 T/G4 > Play Teeth Gleam + Too Near
2. G1 minor (any) /
