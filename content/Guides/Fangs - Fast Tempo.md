Topic - [[Sharp Fangs Behind The Leaves]]
### Intro
Great fun to thrash invaders with, but weak to blight and higher difficultly adversaries.

Goes all-in on Ranging Hunt and aims to shut out the invaders entirely by rapidly devouring their entire society. All of your combat power is in that left innate and you REALLY feel it once they get a chance to build in a blighted land. Don't let that happen! And don't let things blight!!! (Especially your coast)

### Opening
1. G2 Top/G4 > Teeth Gleam + Too Near
2. G1 minor (any, 0-cost best) / G2 Top > Teeth Gleam + Too Near
	- This is your reclaim loop. Continue top until you get 2 energy, then grow from bottom to eventually add some drafted cards into the mix.
