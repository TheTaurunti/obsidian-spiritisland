Topic - [[Fathomless Mud Of The Swamp]]
### Intro

This opening aims to use the special rule often and not miss chances to draft with Exaltation.

Sometimes feels awkward with only hitting tier 1 or tier 2 of the innate (tier 2 is 1 damage). Presence movement on it's own is pretty good, so not the worst problem to have. Does not always feel like it is playing optimally.

### Opening
1. G2 Top/Top > Open Shifting Waterways
	- Put the Dahan into the land an explorer was "built" - prevents blight and cleans up in the ravage next turn
	- Use your innate to shift a presence somewhere that will build next
2. G3 Bot, Minor > Exaltation + Minor or Foul Vapors
	- Grow into the land you shifted presence into, to make use of your special rule.
	- Spend the 2 to draft a Minor
4. G2 Bot/Bot > all cards in hand
	- Keep an eye on which land types you already have presence. Reclaim next turn adds at range 0, so would be good to place it where they explore.
5. Reclaim Top, unless the moon will upgrade your innate this turn
	- Consider gaining a major with Exaltation soon.
6. G2 or G3, work towards 4 plays.
