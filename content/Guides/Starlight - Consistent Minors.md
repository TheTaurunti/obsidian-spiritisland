Topic - [[Starlight Seeks Its Form]]
### Intro
Draft cards quickly to find all the tools you need, with bonus flexibility from regular presence movement.

### Opening
1. G2 to unlock G5b, G3, G5 > Shape (forget it to get 3 energy) + Boon (forget Gather unless both drafted minors Shape are terrible)
	- You gain 4 cards this turn (1 from 4, 1 from 4, 2 from 6)
2. G2 Bot (Typically ![[earth.png]]/![[plant.png]]/![[water.png]] > ![[sun.png]]), G3, G5 > 2 minors
3. G2 Bot (Same as before but don't double up), G5, G1 to replay a great minor, otherwise G3 > any 2
4. G2 Bot, G3, G1 to replay a great minor, otherwise G3 > any 3
5. -- Options open up greatly here, but typically still taking G2 every turn --
	1. Unlocking G6b for +1 card play option is nice
	2. Working towards G7a for reclaim all is also valuable. 
	3. Top track for +1 energy per turn can also be nice but usually the other two options tend to offer more. Consider that while working towards G7 you get +1 energy while uncovering that track.
	4. G8b can be very nice in late game - slow->fast seizing an opportunity to finish the game, much like sky stretches.
