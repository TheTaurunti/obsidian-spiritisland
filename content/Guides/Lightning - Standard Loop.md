Topic - [[Lightning's Swift Strike]]
### Intro
Standard reclaim loop for base Lightning. Struggles at higher difficulties.

The fun in this playstyle is your drafts, as you will likely be playing them every single turn for quite some time.

Try to set up sacred sites in different land types while still getting coverage - easier to protect them one at a time.
### Opening
1. G2 Top/Top > play no cards
2. G2 Bot/Bot > Play all except 3-cost
3. Reclaim loop starts
	- Draft for ![[fire.png]] and ![[air.png]], prioritizing 0-cost ![[fire.png]] over 1-cost ![[fire.png]]![[air.png]]
