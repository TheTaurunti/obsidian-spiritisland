Topic - [[Sharp Fangs Behind The Leaves]]
### Intro
For gambling enthusiasts and major-hunters alike. Play on the edge of your seat in perhaps the most powerful iteration of Sharp Fangs as you play majors every turn! Thresholds not included.

### Opening
1. G2 T/G4 > play at least 1 of Prey or Terrifying, and another unique
2. G2 T/G3 Major (2-3 cost ideal), forget prey/terrifying from discard > major + Prey or Terrifying (whichever you didn't play last turn) or any unique (if you played both)
3. G2 T/G3 Major, forget prey/terrifying from discard > major + unique
4. G1/G4 or G2 (can reroll majors here if too costly) > 1 major + 1 unique
	- You'd like to hit G2 if the budget allows, but G4 if needed will let you keep slinging those majors.
5. G2/G3 or G4 (can reroll major with G3 or just go G4 for energy)

### Other Notes
Cheap cards are king and let you place more presence. You'd like to only be hitting G4 every *other* turn, not every single turn.
