Topic - [[Vengeance As A Burning Plague]]
### Intro

Idea is to smoothly gain and play cards while working towards the magic 3/3 milestone.

### Opening
1. G3 top > Fetid Breath (set up for plaguebearers after upcoming build)
2. G2 bot/bot > Plaguebearers + most relevant card
3. G2 bot/bot > last 2 cards
	- You don't have enough cards this turn to take full advantage of the 3 plays. The idea is to set up for next turn when you reclaim, such that you have many options and plenty of plays to take advantage of them.
4. Reclaim 
	- Start thinking about drafting a major - you will want one relatively soon.


### Other Notes
You can delay your reclaim by 1 additional turn to better set up for drafting a major.
3. G3 bot, gain minor
4. G3 bot, gain minor or major
	- Pro of gaining major here is that you'll know what elements to look for while drafting a minor next turn.
	- Con of gaining major here is that you might not have quite enough energy to play it.
5. Reclaim, gain minor or major (whichever you didn't do last turn)
