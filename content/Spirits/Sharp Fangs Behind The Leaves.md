## Play Patterns
### Beasts, Not Presence
Outside of 1 or 2 turns, you should be using the special rule to replace one of your presence with a beast token EVERY TURN. Ranging hunt and your presence placement options both scale with beasts on the board, and you will want a lot of them.

### Wide-Ranging Predators
It is good to spread out your beasts for the most part. Having just 1 in a land\* allows you to destroy a city on demand where you need it. (\*Add presence from track, convert it to beast. When using ranging hunt, gather a beast from adjacent land for a total of 3, destroy city.)

Consider that, unless you have another action to maneuver beasts into position, that if you have no beasts in a land to start with the most damage you can do with ranging hunt is 1. Having just 1 beast in a land gives you the option of destroying a town, or investing the presence placement as well for a city.

### Right Innate... Sometimes
Fangs' right innate is not nearly as important as it's left innate. Most often, this will come into play once or twice to pick off a city that you otherwise couldn't destroy.

## Drafting
### Minors
0-cost is the name of the game. Your energy income is quite limited and every time you hit G4 it's preventing you from growing in other longer-term ways.

Your most important element drafting is ![[plant.png]], with ![[animal.png]] second. This is because all your unique cards have animal but just 2 have plant. Getting both ![[plant.png]]![[animal.png]] on the same card is great (10/100 cards) but only ONE of those - Carapaced Land - costs zero.

Some amount of blight healing is good. Those usually have ![[plant.png]] and will help you out a lot to keep things open for Ranging Hunt

### Majors
Whatever you draft, it better be 2 or 3 cost, the lower the better. If you pick up a 4-cost, you'll survive but you are losing out on a presence placement later in the game if you do.

Thresholding majors will mainly come down to your other minor drafts! Fangs is pretty one-trick when it come to starting elements.


## Boards
Factors that make a good Fangs board:
1. All lands jungle-adjacent (for your ![[plant.png]]![[animal.png]] unique cards), OR board's beast is in/adjacent to the land missing coverage
2. Board's beast not in jungles (you can access jungles and beast-lands easily)
3. Blighted land does not start with a town (harder to deal with without Ranging Hunt)

Special mention for Board C as your worst because you start in the normal beast land: You have no way to make use of that many beasts in a single land, and until Jungle gets some action you won't have a good reason to push them out with Ranging Hunt

| Priority | Board | Reason                                                                   |
| :------: | :---: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    1     |   B   | All adjacent                                                             |
|    2     |   E   | All adjacent, other beast starts adjacent BUT great pocket potential     |
|    3     |   A   | Missing L1 but other beast starts there                                  |
|    4     |   F   | Missing L7 but other beast starts there                                  |
|    5     |   H   | All adjacent BUT other beast is adjacent and tough to relocate           |
|    6     |   D   | Missing L8, other beast far away                                         |
|    7     |   G   | Missing L3, other beast starts far from it... in the jungle :(           |
|    8     |   C   | Missing L8, other beast starts in jungle... in your starting land... :(( |
