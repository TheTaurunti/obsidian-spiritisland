## Play Patterns


## Drafting
You would REALLY like a 0-cost ![[moon.png]]![[plant.png]], which sadly only matches 5 cards in the minors deck. Obviously not a high likelihood, but always be on the lookout for it as it can set you up for a very powerful set of card plays to hit your maxed innate every turn.

| Draft \# | Chance To Find Here | Chance To Find By Now |
| :------: | :-----------------: | :-------------------: |
|    1     |        18.8%        |         18.8%         |
|    2     |        19.5%        |         34.7%         |
|    3     |        20.3%        |         48.0%         |

## Boards
Eyes prefers boards where every land is within range 1 of a jungle, so that their dahan-gathering unique is maximally effective.

| Priority | Board | Reason                              |
| :------: | :---: | :---------------------------------- |
|    1     |   E   | Fast jungle access, total coverage  |
|    2     |   B   | ""                                  |
|    3     |   H   | ""                                  |
|    4     |   A   | 1 land out of jungle coverage       |
|    5     |   C   | ""                                  |
|    6     |   A   | Same as above + bad dahan positions |
|    7     |   G   | ""                                  |
|    8     |   F   | ""                                  |
