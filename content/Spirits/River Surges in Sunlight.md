|   B    | ![[sun.png]]![[water.png]]![[animal.png]] | River's Bounty | Free energy income for you   |
|   A    |       ![[water.png]]![[earth.png]]        | Wash Away      |                              |

## Play Patterns

Consolidate invaders with innate / Wash Away so you can later obliterate them with flooding

## Drafting

River needs lots of ![[water.png]] and ![[sun.png]] in almost-equal amounts.

Getting a  ![[water.png]]![[sun.png]] card that can replace flash floods is advantageous - will save energy over time.


## Boards
River loves boards where everything is within range 1 of wetlands, so that it can hit flooding VERY easily everywhere. Does well on most everything.
