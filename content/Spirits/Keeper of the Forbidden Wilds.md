## Play Patterns

### Socially Awkward Dahan Tag-Team
Despite appearances, Keeper is a Dahan spirit! Your innate will do a good job eliminating invaders from YOUR lands, so make sure you are supporting the Dahan properly in the other ~3 lands that you've pushed them into.

Ideal coverage looks like you taking care of 1 land of each type, with Dahan on the others. Jungle/Wetlands are easier to leave undefended/without Dahan, because you start with blight removal which can target those.

### Pay 2 Proliferate
Your G4 is STRONG. Aim to keep 2 energy in the bank after most turns so that you can G3 for +1 and then pay 3 for that second presence placement. It also gives you more flexibility in where you put out your presence.

### Spread That Presence
Pushing all Dahan from a land is a powerful effect. When you can, take advantage of it more by making sacred sites with somewhat more thought behind them.

Having 2 or more options for placement on your G3 will avoid some awkward situations where you would have to make a 3-stack because a wilds was consumed during explore.

### Innates For Gameplay
Your right innate is very easy to hit, typically you'll only need 2 ![[sun.png]] and 1 ![[plant.png]] to get the "full" effect. Pushing more explorers is... sometimes useful, and the range bonuses at 3 ![[plant.png]] and 1 ![[air.png]] not particularly notable.

Your left innate is what allows you to fight back invaders who DARE trespass your lands. You only need 2 ![[fire.png]] to get the higher scaling out of it, after which point ![[sun.png]]![[plant.png]] are what pump the damage further, minimally increasing the total to 4/5.
- The 4 ![[plant.png]] threshold for this is a BIG deal. Solving 2 lands simultaneously by destroying both towns is strong, or taking out a city + explorer elsewhere.
- Keep in mind that the Dahan destruction effect here only applies to the land you target into, not the land you split the damage with.

### Sacrosanct Wilderness Damage
This unique is a good combo piece, such as with right innate: explorer built town, you push explorer and place wilds in slow, next fast you deal 2 damage to town, clearing the land.


## Drafting
Your first draft has some specific priorities:
1. 0-cost ![[sun.png]] like Gift of Constancy/Living Energy (Huge support) or Sear Anger (perfect elements) or Call To Isolation / Enticing Splendor (good effects)
2. Defend card
3. Any useful effect / elements

You do not start with any Defend powers, so you'll want to search HARD for a defend the first 1-2 turns. You have a ~50% chance to get a usable Defend card per draft, and even at your unluckiest only 1 in 10[^1] games will have you completely whiff on a defend in the 3 drafts before first ravage (T1 G2, T1 Boon, T2 G4).

After you get a Defend card (or 2), look for minors with ![[fire.png]] so that you can activate your left innate more frequently. If it also has ![[plant.png]] and/or ![[sun.png]] that is even better! Keep looking for these kinds of cards after you get the first one, but don't blindly pick them. You get to play a lot of cards, so get the ones with good effects too!

## Boards
- Keeper likes to start in lands with many adjacencies (more options for right innate). Ideally with each non-jungle land type adjacent. bonus points if all adjacent
- It likes boards where a single presence placed by G4 can make all lands adjacent to your presence, with more options being better
- It likes boards where the starting blight is in Jungle/Wetlands

| Priority | Board | Adjacencies | One G4 | Blight | Notes                                      |
| :------: | :---: | :---------: | :----: | :----: | :----------------------------------------- |
|    1     |   E   |      5      | L2/3/5 |  yes   | Same as H but better pocketing             |
|    2     |   H   |      5      | L1/6/8 |  yes   |                                            |
|    3     |   C   |      4      |   L6   |  yes   |                                            |

|    5     |   G   |      3      |   L2   |        |                                            |
|    6     |   F   |   5 (-W)    |        |        | Ideal G4 land starts blighted              |
|    7     |   D   |   3 (-W)    |        |        |                                            |
|    8     |   B   |   2 (-S)    |  L4\*  |  yes   | G4 land starts blighted, fixable w/ unique |


## Spirit Friends

Likes to receive range bonuses, so it's left innate can target more freely

[^1]: The chances are slightly better than 1 in 8 (50% -> 50% -> 50%) because the pool of cards gets smaller as you dig for a Defend card. The actual chances are 50.8% -> 52.4% -> 54.1%.
