## Guides
- [[Heat - Standard G3]]
- [[Heat - Fast Tempo]]
- [[Heat - Early Major]]

Rising Heat has lots of flexibility in the first 2 turns. Your turn 1 is always a G3, so based on what minor you draft you can jump straight in to any of the above 3 build paths.

Gift of Searing Heat
- In solo, HOLY HELL breaks the game wide open for you. Energy and damage both are useful.
	- Because it is fun, you should definitely try a few games using this on yourself. Generally though I recommend not taking the bonus for self playing solo, because the difference compared to multiplayer is just that tremendous.
- In multiplayer, ignore the damage text. If they take the damage, they are effectively paying 3 energy (1 cost + opportunity cost of gaining 2) to deal a measly 1 damage in a land.


## Play Patterns

A good amount of success found with this spirit will be in playing for it's innate power. It's very strong and capable of completely wiping out a land when maxed.

## Drafting
0-cost cards are king! Energy is very limited.

To max out your innate, you only need a single ![[earth.png]]-element card alongside your unique cards at 1e/5p. You'll have ~4 drafts before unlocking 5 plays, which gives you an excellent chance to get such a card, as shown below

| Draft # | Chance To Find Now | Chance To Find By Now |
| :-----: | :----------------: | :-------------------: |
|    1    |       45.8%        |         45.8%         |
|    2    |       47.3%        |         71.5%         |
|    3    |       48.9%        |         85.4%         |
|    4    |       50.7%        |         92.8%         |

## Boards
Initial presence placement is the primary concern, due to G3 presence placement having a range of 1. More initial adjacencies and options to grow around are better options to start with.

The second consideration is Sweltering Exhaustion, which has a range of 2 from sacred site. Ideally your whole board will be within range when you want to use this, which some boards provide more advantageously

Rising Heat only experiences inconveniences with board choices. Some have advantages but the worst cases are just a little awkward in the first couple turns. Very resilient in this aspect.

| Priority | Board | Reason                                     |
| :------: | :---: | :----------------------------------------- |
|    1     |   G   | L5 start 5 adjacent, all in range 2        |
|    2     |   B   | L5 start 4 adjacent, all in range 2        |
|    3     |   C   | ""                                         |
|    4     |   E   | L7 start 3 adjacent, coast access limited  |
|    5     |   F   | L3 is problem! Awkward coast access        |
|    6     |   D   | Can't G2 into coast - all wetland/jungle   |
|    7     |   H   | Awkward coastal access                     |
|    8     |   A   | L7 start 2 adjacent(!!!), bad coast access |
