## Play Patterns
Aim to "fully" unlock memory by reaching 3e/2p (typically turn 4). After that point you will have flexibility to progress either track further or to start taking G4 to throw haymakers.

### Left Innate / Card Plays
Memory will be stuck on 2 card plays almost always. The left innate's defend 3 is a pseudo third-card each turn and will do greatly in keeping you from getting overwhelmed

### Right Innate / Element Preparation
Common scenario is to pay 1 marker to go from 1st to 2nd level of the right innate. Place it where you get an immediate refund on that marker and another shortly after. You can count on luck to grant the third marker, especially from lands with beasts/dahan/disease.

There is a simple priority to follow when considering what markers to gain:
1. Always have 1 ![[moon.png]] banked for your right innate
2. Get whatever you need to threshold majors
	- You can also bank markers to support the team here
3. Gain some ![[earth.png]] to keep your defend consistent
4. Finally, get another 1-2 ![[moon.png]] and ![[earth.png]] for good measure

### Forgetting Cards / Special Rule
Strong feature - learn majors for free, forget cards for free to pay for events or deal with blighted island effects. 

Consider reclaiming slightly more often with Memory so that you can take advantage of this.

## Drafting
Memory typically gains 2-3 majors per game. Difficult to end the game with just 1, and you'll only get a 4th major if your initial picks are weak... or you are bored.

Tiers are meant for quick reference, based on board state a lower "tier" might be exactly what you need to solve things. 

On the fly, your best options for majors have moon element and can solve a lot in 2+ lands.

### S-Tier
Drafting one of these T1 will typically win you the game.

### A-Tier
Well-costed majors that typically have moon or earth elements
Many affect multiple lands. 
The thresholds are typically achievable and worth the effort.  

| Priority |        Name         | Cost |     Moon?     | Multi-Land |
| :------: | :-----------------: | :--: | :-----------: | :--------: |

|    17    |  Paralyzing Fright  |  4   |               |            |

### B-Tier
They are usually not quite what we are looking for but will work fine.
Typically handle just one land, and require thresholding, which may be difficult. 

| Priority |          Name           | Cost |     Moon?     | Multi-Land |
| :------: | :---------------------: | :--: | :-----------: | :--------: |

|    17    | Melt Earth to Quicksand |  4   | ![[moon.png]] |            |

## Boards
Memory likes boards where every land is accessible at range 1 via two sacred sites, for the reason of using Secrets of Survival anywhere it is needed.

| Priority | Board | Reason                       |
| :------: | :---: | :--------------------------- |
|    1     |   E   | Best overall                 |
|    2     |   B   | Lands accessible             |
|    3     |   C   | ""                           |
|    4     |   D   | ""                           |
|    5     |   F   | Awkward Dahan                |
|    6     |   G   | ""                           |
|    7     |   H   | ""                           |
|    8     |   A   | 7/8 coverage + awkward Dahan |
