## Drafting
Minor Draft Priorities - Energy is almost always tight!
You need about twice as much air as you do sun.
1. Draft the cheapest card you can that has ![[air.png]]. A card with ![[sun.png]]![[air.png]] is a great find, but think carefully about the trade-off if it will involve paying an additional energy for that ![[sun.png]].
2. If no cards have ![[air.png]], get the cheapest useful card you can.

Draft-able Minors:
- 0-cost
	- 6 with both ![[sun.png]]![[air.png]]
	- 9 with only ![[air.png]]
- 1-cost
	- 6 with both ![[sun.png]]![[air.png]]
	- 17 with only ![[air.png]]

Draft Chances:
- Any minor with ![[air.png]]: ~90%
- Any 0-cost with ![[air.png]]: ~50%
- Any minor with ![[sun.png]]![[air.png]]: ~40%
- Any 0-cost with ![[sun.png]]![[air.png]]: ~20%

## Boards
Because you are often using your presence placement to disrupt invaders, you will likely find yourself without many sacred sites. 
1. The "best" starting boards are those with full coverage if you finish your high-sands sacred site or make a second site elsewhere from scratch.
2. The "good" boards are those with solid initial adjacency but require finishing the high-sands site and creating a third one from scratch at some point, typically only having 1 land outside it's coverage.
3. The "avoidable" boards are those with poor initial adjacencies you could get coverage with get a better rating than boards that would need you to make one from scratch (which is unlikely due to explore frequency), and those still are rated higher than boards requiring you to make 3 sacred sites for total coverage. 

Total coverage is not strictly necessary, however you will find that starting in a land with many adjacencies, and having likely sacred site coverage after Stage 1 explores will make the game smoother.

| Priority | Board | Reason                                        |
| :------: | :---: | :-------------------------------------------- |
|    1     |   E   | Fast sacred site                              |
|    2     |   C   | ""                                            |
|    3     |   H   | ""                                            |
|    4     |   F   | Slow sacred site in L1 or L5                  |
|    5     |   D   | 5 adjacent, missing L3 after fast sacred site |
|    6     |   A   | 4 adjacent, missing L3 after fast sacred site |
|    7     |   B   | 3 adjacent, missing L8 after fast sacred site |
|    8     |   G   | 2 adjacent, missing L3 after fast sacred site |
