## Play Patterns

### Reclaim Loop
It is possible to reclaim and get your max innate each turn once you reach 3e/4p. It's a very strong combination of effects, so consider doing so once you reach that point in the game. You gain some flexibility for support cards when you uncover the ![[water.png]] on your top track, so it's a slightly more forgiving loop.

## Drafting
Your most important element is ![[water.png]], and keep a strong eye out for ![[moon.png]]![[water.png]] cards. Only 2 of the starting hand comes with ![[moon.png]] and a combination of both is very good to get. You'll often find those dual-element cards to be your limiting factor in upgrading your innate.

## Boards
Land type variety adjacent to starting land is a big deal. It allows for smoothly dealing with first explores by way of special rule. Starting in the middle of the board is better, as it lets you cut off buildings from the inland earlier in the game. If you must start on the coast, it is best to start in lands 1 or 3, as the disease in land 2 makes your special rule somewhat redundant in the opening.

| Priority | Board | Reason                                          |
| :------: | :---: | :---------------------------------------------- |
|    1     |   C   | Middle of board start, far lands are 2 away     |
|    2     |   H   | ""                                              |
|    3     |   E   | ""                                              |
|    4     |   B   | Coast start L1, far lands 2 away                |
|    5     |   D   | ""                                              |
|    6     |   G   | Coast start L2 (disease land) far land 2 away   |
|    7     |   A   | Coast start L2 (disease land) far land 3 away   |
|    8     |   F   | Missing adjacent land type, far land is range 3 |
