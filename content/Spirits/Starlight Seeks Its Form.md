## Play Patterns

### EARTH ENDURES
Your earth innate is strong! 5 defence is a downright perfect number to prevent blighting vs a wide variety of adversaries and situations. Playing around this innate and organizing counterattacks will serve you well.

### Easy Sacred Sites
Your only presence placement option is at range 0. Add that to your possibilities for moving presence while gaining a card or a card play and you have a lot of freedom to create a sacred site where you need it, right when you need it.

## Drafting
Three elements will consistently serve you well with your innates: ![[water.png]]![[earth.png]]![[plant.png]]
- High defend and blight removal give you strong tools for fending off invaders.
- More card drafts from the plant element will give you even more tools

Dahan movement is valuable - your innate lets you defend, so the other piece of the puzzle is getting them into position.

## Boards
There are no features of any island board A-H that benefit or hurt Starlight specifically.
