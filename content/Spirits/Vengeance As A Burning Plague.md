## Play Patterns

### Presence Tracks, Innates And You
- The importance of 3e/3p: Vengeance truly shines when it reaches this point as it will have the energy income to handle it's expensive uniques while also finally becoming capable of reaching the second threshold on it's innates.
- The second tier of both innates are VERY worthwhile to pursue. 2x dmg for the left and 3x dmg for the right if you reach the second threshold. 4x ![[fire.png]]/![[animal.png]] REQUIRES 3 plays to threshold.
	- Your right innate is somewhat easier to hit higher thresholds with than your left, needing 1 less and 2 less total elements for the tier2/3 thresholds respectively.
- If you don't gain cards with G3 you will find yourself reclaiming far too often.

### Nothing Sacred About The Plague
Take note of your unique powers - none of them require a sacred site for targeting. While it is easy to set up a sacred site in a problem land with your G2, you'll often be fairly spread out trying to scale up disease counts until the mid/late-game turns. 

### No Blight Without Lizards
Whenever you can, make sure that any land that is going to blight has one of your presence in it. This gives you a free disease token which scales your damage dealing and build/ravage-skipping options. Ideally, not a single blight on your starting board will come down without you running in at the last minute to get some value out of it. Chances are decent that you will be able to do this once or twice on neighboring boards as well.

### Greed Without Madness
You can milk a ton of fear and disease out of the invaders by allowing builds and ravages respectively. A key skill for mastering Vengeance is to identify when it is time to start cashing in disease to lower invader tempo, and when to stop allowing blights.
- Having 2-3 additional blight on your board is usually sufficient to destroy everything.
- When to prevent builds is a more difficult balance of concerns. A situation where preventing a build might also prevent some following inland explores would definitely be worthwhile. Preventing a build such that dahan can clear the land and avoid another build the following turn is also worthwhile.

## Drafting
Vengeance tends to have 1 or 2 sacred sites at most, and typically not until later in the game. Keep this in mind while drafting so you can adapt to situations where you really need those sacred site cards.

Here is a secret: Vengeance is actually a beast spirit!! ![[fire.png]]![[water.png]]![[animal.png]] is the holy trinity of beast elements, found on knockout cards such as Sea Monsters, Angry Bears, Venomous Spiders, Hunger of the Swarm... each one is SO EASILY thresholded by the cards you are already drafting to trigger your innates!

Your best elemental combinations are: ![[fire.png]]![[water.png]]![[animal.png]], then ![[fire.png]]![[animal.png]], then ![[water.png]]![[animal.png]], then ![[animal.png]] and ![[fire.png]] individually. Innates have comparable damage, left usually feels more suited to knocking down the tallest lands.

|    2     |   B   | ""                                   |
|    3     |   E   | Better when vs Sweden                |
|    3     |   A   | Solid choice                         |
|    3     |   D   | ""                                   |
|    3     |   H   | ""                                   |
|    3     |   G   | ""                                   |
