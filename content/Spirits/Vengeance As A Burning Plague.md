## Play Patterns

### 3/3 Potential
Reaching 3e/3p is a good milestone for any spirit, and on vengeance it is worth making a priority.

### Nothing Sacred About The Plague
Take note of your unique powers - none of them require a sacred site for targeting. While it is easy to set up a sacred site in a problem land with your G2, you'll often be fairly spread out trying to scale up disease counts until the mid/late-game turns.

### No Blight Without Lizards
Whenever you can, make sure that any land that is going to blight has one of your presence in it. This gives you a free disease token which scales your damage dealing and build/ravage-skipping options. Ideally, not a single blight on your starting board will come down without you running in at the last minute to get some value out of it. Chances are you will be able to do this once or twice on neighboring boards as well.

### How Much Blight Does A Lizard Like?


### Dead Spaces


## Drafting
Sacred site targeting restrictions are a slight negative playing as vengeance
Vengeance is actually secretly a beast spirit.
