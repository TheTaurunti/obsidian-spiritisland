## Site Principles & Explanation
Inspired by the [LatentOctopus Spirit Island Hub](https://latentoctopus.github.io/)

The purpose of this is to compile spirit openings and tactics for easy reference. While some basic information such as spirit boards is provided within, it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with core gameplay concepts. You will find deeper analysis of spirits in the guides linked at the bottom of each spirit page.
